    While Charles Darwin (1809-1882) identified two phenomena — variation by
    random mutation and adaptation by natural selection — in his theory of
    evolution, he did not provide a mechanism for inheritance. Although, at the
    time, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829) offered a theory of inheritance of
    acquired traits, it was soon supplanted by the classical theory of genetics,
    founded by Gregor Johann Mendel (1822-1884) in his pea experiments and later
    elaborated by Thomas Hunt Morgan (1866–1945) in his chromosome theory.
    Recently, with the advent of the field of epigenetics, Lamarckism has
    experienced a revival.<br>

    Although examples of evolution by natural selection is ubiquitous, it is but
    one system of an encompassing phenomenon of self-organization.
    Self-organization is a process by which global pattern emerges solely from
    local interactions among components of a system. The rules specifying such
    interactions are executed using local information, without reference to the
    global pattern.<br>
    <br>
    Order can emerge from apparent chaos of a self-organizing dynamical, complex
    system. In living systems, self-organization is responsible for social
    behaviors in insects, patterns in animal body coverings, networks of spiking
    neurons, selection of division sites in cells, formation of microtubules,
    etc. In non-living systems, self-organization is involved in nonequilibrium
    thermodynamics, molecular self-assembly, diffusion, crystal formation,
    geological formation, sand dune ripple formation, etc.<br>

    In the study of fractal geometry, where we try to make sense of chaotic
    patterns in space and time, it is believed that self-organization follows
    fractal laws and fractal patterns emerge from self-organizing systems. With
    the same logic, the process of genetic evolution emerges from information
    provided by living systems, and species arise from genetic evolution.
    Arguably, such observation is consistent with phenomena ranging from the
    behavior of elementary particles to the state of the universe, and just
    about everything in between.<br>
    <br>
    Currently, self-organization as applied to the human society is widely
    studied — from market economics to linguistics, from herd behavior to drug
    trafficking, and from computer networks to social networks, all of which
    operate within the framework of a system undergoing natural selection.<br>
    <br>
    Another widely recognized emergent property is synchrony. Activities of
    spiking neurons, flashes of fireflies, chirps of crickets or applause of an
    audience falls quickly into a pattern without direction from a central
    authority. In music, a jam session produces ordered sound without a
    director. It is conceivable that if we treat music as a multi-species
    evolutionary system, where rudimentary musical phrases are primitive
    organisms undergoing genetic evolution and community self-organization, an
    optimized piece of music will emerge.<br>

    In building an optimized biological ecosystem, the goal is to evolve and
    concurrently self-organize populations of species into interacting, stable
    communities.<br>
    <br>
    The method is to build on a rudimentary genetic algorithm with computational
    techniques based on self-organization principles.
    <h4 style="background-color: #eeeeee;">Genetic Evolution</h4>
    A species adapts to its environment by undergoing the following stages of
    neo-Darwinian evolution:<br>
    <ul style="background-color: #eeeeee;">
      <li>Selection of the fittest</li>
      <li>Recombinant reproduction</li>
      <li>Variation by mutation</li>
    </ul>
    A common genetic algorithm models a organism with one strand of DNA
    undergoing the these three stages of adaptation.<br>
    <br>
    For our purposes, the evolutionary process is implemented computationally by
    an enhanced genetic algorithm, which emulates an ecosystem with the
    following elements.<br>
    <ul style="background-color: #eeeeee;">
      <li>An <span style="font-weight: bold;">ecosystem</span> consists of
        multiple species.</li>
      <li>Each <span style="font-weight: bold;">species</span> consists of a
        population of organisms.</li>
      <li>Each <span style="font-weight: bold;">organism</span> contains one or
        more chromosomes.</li>
      <li>Each <span style="font-weight: bold;">chromosome</span> consists of
        two strands of DNA, each comprises a sequence of nucleotides.</li>
      <li>Each <span style="font-weight: bold;">nucleotide</span> is the basic
        unit of genotype which undergoes reproduction and mutation.</li>
      <li>Each <span style="font-weight: bold;">gene</span>, which consists of
        one or more nucleotides, is expressed as a phenotype of an organism
        subject to selection.</li>
    </ul>
    The goal is to evolve one or more species, with each organism of a species
    possessing a random set of genetic materials, into an optimal population
    based on fitness criteria. In each generation, each organism's genes are
    evaluated and assigned a fitness value. Then the organism are selected for
    mating. The fitter the organism, the more probable that it is selected for
    mating and more of its phenotype will be inherited. Reproduction is optional
    under the constraint of a reproduction rate of a species. During
    reproduction, each parent's DNA is cut at a common point. The sections are
    swapped by crossover and recombination, producing two children. Mutation of
    the offspring is optional based on a small mutation rate imposed on each
    nucleotide. When it does occur, a random nucleotide replaces an existing
    one. The process continues for the new generation.<br>
    <br>
    The reproduction and mutation processes are enhanced with
    self-organizational computations.<br>
    <br>
    An emergent property of Darwinian evolution is speciation by divergence,
    where under certain conditions, a population of organisms branch to evolve
    as a different species. The enhanced genetic algorithm includes this
    evolutionary process. Interdependent species may co-evolve from the start
    under the condition of the environment while other species evolve, after
    several generations, when they diverge from established species. Another
    mode of speciation is hybridization where a new species emerge from genetic
    materials of two existing species. <br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
    <h4 style="background-color: #eeeeee;">Epigenetic Inheritance </h4>
    While genetic evolution enables heritable changes in the DNA sequence, or
    nucleotides, thus determining the genotype of an organism, mechanisms of
    epigenetic inheritance enable such changes in gene expression thus
    determining the phenotype. It is the phenotype of an organism that undergoes
    selection. The mechanisms used in our model include adaptation algorithms
    following self-organization principles. <br>
    <h4 style="background-color: #eeeeee;">Community Organization</h4>
    Given a primitive species, genetic evolution with epigenetic inheritance
    promises to produce a population of organisms with improved fitness. In
    building an optimal community, organisms in each species interact with each
    other, while multiple communities of species synchronizes with each other.
    Whereas adaptation by evolutionary inheritance proceeds vertically in time,
    organisms in an ecosystem may organize laterally to build a community. A
    stage is added to the evolutionary algorithm in order to enable<br>
    <ol style="background-color: #eeeeee;">
      <li>Members of each species to organize among themselves to form a fitter
        community</li>
      <li>Multiple species of the ecosystem organize with each other to form
        stable inter-species community</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 style="background-color: #eeeeee;">Self-Organization in Evolution</h4>
    The evolutionary algorithm applies several self-organizational methods for
    computation. Cellular automaton and neural network are adaptation method
    that are used in the genetic expression and species selection. The
    phenomenon of fractals is used in species organization.

    <h3 style="background-color: #eeeeee;">Building a Musical Equivalent</h3>
    <span style="font-style: italic;"></span> The goal is to evolve and
    concurrently self-organize sets of random musical events into an optimized
    song in MIDI file format.<br>
    <br>
    The method is to model the musical system after an ecosystem, where the
    world contains multiple species that evolve and interact under conditions of
    their environment and rules for fitness into an optimal state.<br>
    <br>
    In emulation of an ecosystem, the music generation process is implemented
    computationally by an enhanced genetic algorithm with the following
    elements.<br>
    <ul style="background-color: #eeeeee;">
      <li>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">song</span> consists of multiple
        parts or MIDI tracks, usually organized by instruments.</li>
      <li>Each <span style="font-weight: bold;">part</span> consists of a
        population of phrases.</li>
      <li>Each <span style="font-weight: bold;">phrase</span> contains one or
        more chords or harmonic parts.</li>
      <li>Each <span style="font-weight: bold;">chord</span> consists of two
        distinctive strands of musical units arranged in sequence.</li>
      <li>Each <span style="font-weight: bold;">unit</span> undergoes
        reproduction and mutation.</li>
      <li>Each <span style="font-weight: bold;">event</span>, which consists of
        one or more units, is expressed as a musical note of a phrase subject to
        selection.</li>
    </ul>
    As in genetic evolution, the goal is to evolve one or more parts, with each
    phrase of a part possessing a random set of musical units, into an optimal
    song based on fitness criteria. As in Darwinian speciation a song containing
    multiple parts may co-evolve in synchrony, under the constraint of initial
    conditions and criteria for optimal sound. Whereas other parts may diverge
    from partially developed, existing parts or a hybrid may form from two
    existing parts.<br>
    <br>
    <p style="background-color: #eeeeee;"> Whereas genetic evolution enables
      heritable changes in musical units, mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance
      enable such changes by the interpretation, and realization, of the units
      into musical events. It is the expressed musical events of a phrase that
      undergoes selection.</p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>Given a primitive set of musical
    units, genetic evolution with epigenetic inheritance promises to produce a
    population of phrases with improved fitness. From these phrases, the
    algorithm constructs a musical architecture with self-organization
    principles to enable <br>
    <ol style="background-color: #eeeeee;">
      <li>Members of each parts to organize among themselves to produce a
